DO NOT EDIT THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY BY HAND!

This directory contains the definition and logic for generating
the `parser-X.php` and the `lalr-X.json` it references.

One needs the NPM package named `first-follow` in additon to `fs` to execute,
these scripts.

The first script to execute is `lalr-X.js` which will check the definition in
`bottom-up-grammar-X.json` and turns it to various debug and intermediate
results. Then one executes `php-generator-X.js` which will generate the actual
end result.


Note that not all debug output is sensible or usable for the full grammar,
for example do not expect to compile `graph.dot` in a sensible time and even if
you do compile it do not expect any normal viewer to be able to open it with
default settings. There is a reason, for that `.gitignore` do not push those,
intermediary results to the repository.
